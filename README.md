# Mini Portfolio

>This is a mini portfolio developed by me ðŸ˜„. 

It is quite simple, but functional to introduce myself a little and to present my work.

>I will gradually develop new features to make it more beautiful.  

I have done it with the following technologies:

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Vite**
- **Lucide Icons** (SVG icon library)
- **PostCSS**

I hope you like it.
